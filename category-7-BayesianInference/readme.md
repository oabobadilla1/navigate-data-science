Bayesian Inference is a branch of Machine Learning that provides not only the predictions but also quantifies uncertainty in the predictions. This utilizes Bayes Theorem to explore the possible parameter values that gives rise to the observed predictions. In this repo, we will have basic illustrative examples of Bayesian Inference, which is also referred to as Probabilistic programming.
