# Navigating the Data Science World

Data Science is fascinating to its practitioners due to the breadth & depth of solutions it can offer to a wide range of problems. But there is also the danger of getting lost among all the techniques & hype. This talk is intended to help formulate a simple, personal data science map of sorts for individuals as they try to navigate this world in their own way.

**Here is my list of Ten Categories to help navigate the world of data science**

> Category-1: Supervised Machine Learning on Structured data

> Category-2: Supervised Machine Learning on Unstructured data

> Category-3: Supervised Machine Learning on Time-series data

> Category-4: Unsupervised Machine Learning on Structured data

> Category-5: Unsupervised Machine Learning on Unstructured data

> Category-6: Reinforcement Learning & Artificial Intelligence

> Category-7: Bayesian Inference / Probabilistic Programming

> Category-8: Scalable Machine Learning

> Category-9: Optimization

> Category-10: Machine Learning in Production (Web Services, HTML5, Big Data, Cloud, Containers, etc.)

This repository has my Jupyter notebooks for each category I have formulated. Keep Learning & Enjoy!
